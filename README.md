# Original authors
this repo is based on https://github.com/dlbas/DHCP-Sniffer, scapy branch, but thanks to github and the impossibility to merge the scapy branch with master, i decided to make another repo in which scapy is master.

# Packet sniffer
This is a cross-platform Python based application for capturing unknown network device's IP address.

The idea is straightforward - listen for all packets on specified web interface and try to capture any DHCP-packets
a device could broadcast. If DHCP packet is captured - device is considered in a `DYNAMIC` mode and its IP address will
be shown. Otherwise, if for some number of packets (10 by default) a device did not broadcast any packets - it is 
considered in a `STATIC` mode and IP address it was using is shown. Devices are identified by MAC-addresses.

# Requirements

**General**:
* Python 3.6+
* pycap

**For Windows (in addition)**:
* ncap (https://nmap.org/npcap/)


# Usage
## Linux
1. Usage
   * <-i interface> : specify the **NAME** of the interface from `--show-interfaces`.
    Default is your primary public net interface.
   * <-d> : show more detail captured packet information including source/dest IP, source/dest MAC, and DHCP option 12, 50, 53, 54, 55. All __DHCP broadcast__ are captured.
   ```bash
    user@machine:~/DHCP-Sniffer$ sudo python3 sniffer.py -h
    usage: sniffer.py [-h] [-d] [-i INTERFACE] [--show-interfaces]

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -d, --detail          show all packets to specified iface
      -i INTERFACE, --interface INTERFACE
                            specify interface to work with
      --show-interfaces     get list of all available ifaces
   ```
2. Display possible device type, time, mac-address and IP address. Only __DHCP Request__ is shown.
   ``` bash
    user@machine:~/DHCP-Sniffer$ sudo python3 sniffer.py
    Type       Time                           MAC                  IP                  
    STATIC 2019-05-14 19:00:21 +0300      b0:e1:7e:7e:xx:xx    173.194.163.223     
    Can open browser at http://173.194.163.223
    STATIC 2019-05-14 19:00:26 +0300      50:9e:a7:84:xx:xx    192.168.0.16        
   ```
3. Show all packets (except the ones from used net-interface) passing through the net interface.
    ```.bash
    user@machine:~/DHCP-Sniffer$ sudo python3 sniffer.py -d
    Capturing all packets to interface wlp2s0
    Ether / IP / TCP 64.233.165.198:https > 192.168.0.8:55330 A
    Ether / IP / TCP 64.233.165.198:https > 192.168.0.8:55330 A
    Ether / IP / TCP 216.173.94.113:https > 192.168.0.8:35846 PA / Raw
    Ether / IP / TCP 216.173.94.113:https > 192.168.0.8:35846 A
    ```
4. List all network interfaces that script can use:
    ```bash
    user@machine:~/DHCP-Sniffer$ sudo python3 sniffer.py --show-interfaces
    NAME                 MAC                  IP                  
    lo                   00:00:00:00:xx:xx    127.0.0.1           
    docker_gwbridge      02:42:c6:dc:xx:xx    172.21.0.1          
    br-c42154d5a265      02:42:86:6c:xx:xx    172.20.0.1          
    docker0              02:42:54:28:xx:xx    172.17.0.1          
    wlp2s0               34:41:5d:3a:xx:xx    192.168.0.8         
    veth6f48e79          32:92:1c:2f:xx:xx    0.0.0.0            
    ```

## Windows
Everything is pretty much the same, except:

* no ip addresses of in `--show-interfaces` are shown. Make sure you are using  the
    right one by using `ipconfig /all` - you can match interfaces by name and MAC-address ("Physical address").
